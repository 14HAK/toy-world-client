            differences between uncontrolled and controlled components:

            Uncontrolled and controlled components in React refer to different
            approaches for managing form inputs and their corresponding state.
            Here are the key differences between them
            <ul className='pt-3'>
              <li>
                State Management: In uncontrolled components, the component's
                state is managed by the DOM itself, and React does not have
                direct control over the component's values. On the other hand,
                controlled components have their state managed by React using
                component state or external state management libraries.
              </li>
              <li>
                Value Handling: Uncontrolled components allow the DOM to handle
                the input values directly. You can access the input values using
                DOM methods like getElementById or ref. In controlled
                components, the value of the input elements is controlled by
                React and stored in component state. Changes to the input values
                are handled through event handlers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Validation and Error Handling: With uncontrolled components, it
                can be more challenging to implement form validation and error
                handling since the state is managed outside of React. Controlled
                components make it easier to implement validation and error
                handling by controlling the state in React, allowing you to
                validate input values before updating the state.
              </li>
              <li>
                Testing: Controlled components are easier to test since their
                values and behaviors are controlled by React. You can easily
                simulate user interactions by updating the state and asserting
                the expected behavior. Uncontrolled components require more
                effort to test since you need to access and manipulate the DOM
                directly.

            How to validate React props using PropTypes:
          </h2>
          <hr className='border border-cyan-600 mb-5' />
          <p>
            1. Install the prop-types package if it's not already installed. You
            can install it using npm or yarn: $- npm install prop-types
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Import the PropTypes object from the prop-types package in your
            component file. jsx- import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Define the prop types for your component by assigning them to the
            propTypes property of your component.jsx:
            <pre>...............</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            4.PropTypes.string // Validates that the prop is a string should be
            numbers, boolean etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.By defining prop types using PropTypes, you can catch potential
            errors and validate the props being passed to your components, which
            helps in maintaining code quality and reducing bugs.

            React useRef Hook, How to Work?
          </h2>
          <hr className='border border-cyan-600 mb-5' />
          <p>
            The useRef hook in React allows you to create a mutable reference to
            a DOM element or any other value, which can persist across
            re-renders of a component. It can be used to access and modify a DOM
            node directly, or to store any other type of mutable data that you
            want to persist between renders.

            Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript
            code outside of a browser. It provides a server-side platform for
            building scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js is
            built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven,
            non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient for handling
            concurrent requests. Node.js enables you to build server-side
            applications, command-line tools, microservices, and more using
            JavaScript.

            Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js.
            It provides a set of features and utilities to simplify the
            development of web applications. Express.js is minimalist and
            unopinionated, giving developers the flexibility to structure and
            design their applications according to their needs. Express.js
            provides routing capabilities, middleware support, and templating
            engines, making it easy to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and
            render dynamic content. Express.js is widely adopted and has a large
            ecosystem of plugins and middleware packages that enhance its
            functionality.

            What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?

            Reusability: Custom hooks promote code reuse by allowing you to
            encapsulate and share common logic across different components. They
            enable you to extract and abstract complex or repetitive logic into
            a single function, making it easier to maintain and reuse in
            multiple parts of your application. Composition: Custom hooks enable
            you to compose multiple hooks and combine their functionality. This
            allows you to build more complex behaviors by combining smaller,
            reusable hooks. It promotes modular and composable code, making it
            easier to manage and reason about. Abstraction: Custom hooks can
            abstract away the implementation details of a specific feature or
            functionality, providing a clean and simplified interface to use in
            your components. They encapsulate the inner workings of the logic
            and expose a higher-level API, making it easier to understand and
            use the functionality. Code organization: Custom hooks help to keep
            your component code focused and concise. By extracting stateful
            logic into custom hooks, you can separate concerns and keep your
            components clean and easy to read. It improves code organization and
            maintainability.
